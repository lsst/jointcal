type remains undefined until a user defines it.
The std::list related operations (insertion,
sort, traversal) are to be carried out using STL
list operations. Most of the
Star operations rely on routines to be provided in
the Star class, usually
user defined. The instanciation of this class for
BaseStar (i.e. the replacement
of the formal parameter 'Star' by 'BaseStar') is
called BaseStarList.
Take care: what is stored is pointers on Star's and
NOT Star's. This implies
that Stars being inserted in the std::list have to be
obtained using 'new'.  */
